<b>Introduction</b>
<br>
Hello, I am <a href="http://plus.google.com/+GregWillardr3pwn">r3pwn</a> and today, I guess, I will begin to teach you mobile source apps modification. Don't worry, it only consists of a few steps really.
<br>
<br>
<b>Picking a file</b>
<br>
First you start with picking a file you want to modify. Then, extract it from your app's obb file.
<br>
<br>
<b>What to do?</b>
<br>
Well, now, you make your changes to the file and put it under "/data/data/com.nvidia.valvesoftware.portal/files" or "/data/data/com.nvidia.valvesoftware.halflife2/files", depending on which game you own. You can find my modified files for Portal <a href="http://r3pwn.github.io/files/portal-modded.zip">here</a> and my modified files for Half-Life 2 <a href="http://r3pwn.github.io/files/hl2-modded.zip">here</a>. For my Portal files, extract the zip to the "portal" folder in Portal's app files. For my HL2 files, extract the zip to the "hl2" folder in HL2's app files. 
<br>
<br>
<b>What do we do next?</b>
<br>
Now it's time for the final step. Permissions changing. Hook up your SHIELD via adb or open a Terminal Emulator and issue the following commands (Please note that "yourgamefiles" is /data/data/com.nvidia.valvesoftware.portal/files is you applied the mod to Portal or /data/data/com.nvidia.valvesoftware.halflife2/files if you applied the mod to Half-Life 2):
<br>
<i><br>su
<br>cd yourgamefiles
<br>ls -na</i>
<br>
<br>After that, you need to look for the 5 digit number that should appear twice on most items. Let's call that our "5dn" (stands for 5 digit number). Then issue the following commands:
<br>
<i><br>chown 5dn *
<br>chown 5dn */*
<br>chown 5dn */*/*
<br>chown 5dn */*/*/*
<br>chown 5dn */*/*/*/*
<br>chown 5dn */*/*/*/*/*
<br>chgrp 5dn *
<br>chgrp 5dn */*
<br>chgrp 5dn */*/*
<br>chgrp 5dn */*/*/*
<br>chgrp 5dn */*/*/*/*
<br>chgrp 5dn */*/*/*/*/*<br>
</i>
<br>
<b>(It's okay if one or more of those commands gives an error of "No such file or directory".)</b>
<br>
After that, your permissions should be fixed. Start up the game and see if anything looks/functions any different!
<br>
<br>Happy Modding!

<br><b>P.S.</b> If this guide was too complicated for you <i>OR</i> you didn't understand it <i>OR</i> it didn't work for you, don't worry. I am making an automated patcher application as we speak. :)
